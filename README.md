## Description
This app has two pages: 
- One search page which fetches movies from the [Open Movie Database API](https://www.omdbapi.com). For each search result item you could add the movie in question to the Watchlist. The movie is then saved to localstorage.
- One Watchlist page where your saved movies are read from localstorage, and listed on the page.
